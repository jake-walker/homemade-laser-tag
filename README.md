# Parts

## Electronics

**Notes**
* *All parts (currently) have free shipping to the UK or are available to pick up from Argos for free.*
* *Most parts are from China so may take about a month to arrive to the UK. This makes everything a lot cheaper.*

## Case

I plan to use an old Nerf Gun which I plan to take the innards out of and put in the electronics. This would be the cheapest option for me as I have one laying around I don't need. However, you could use any toy gun. Make sure you can easily put a switch near the trigger which will be pressed when the trigger is pulled.
